    <p>I have experience teaching a broad range of linguistics courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. I have taught linguistics courses at three universities, with class sizes ranging from a dozen to a few hundred. I also have taught syntax and semantics for linguistics majors and a semantics course for MA students. I am strongly committed to diverse teaching opportunities teaching and as such have imparted courses on linguistics in three different languages (English, Spanish and Ch'ol). I frequently integrate my resesarch with Ch'ol, Mi'gmaq and other languages of the Americas into my lectures and seminars. </p>

    <h2>University of Oklahoma</h2>
<ul>
      <li><b>General Linguistics</b> (S2022): An introduction to the core subfields of linguistics (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) as well as looks into their applications to language acquisition, neurolinguistics, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and animal communication.</li>
     <li><b>Linguistic Field Methods</b> (S2022): In this advanced undergraduate course, students got a hands-on experience working with an unfamiliar language by applying their knowledge of various subfields of linguistics. Working with a language consultant, students conducted independent research projects on a topic of their choice. This semester, we worked with a speaker of Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian from Bosnia. </li>
      <li><b>Syntax</b> (F2021): This course offered students an introduction to generative grammar, focusing on topics such as X-bar theory, DP movement, case assignment, wh-movement, and Binding Theory. Students were given problem sets with data from a range of diverse languages and applied their theoretical knowledge to unfamiliar languages. </li>
     <li><b>Semantics</b> (F2021): We investigated meaning across language by taking in-depth looks into entailments, truth conditions, presuppositions, implicatures, quantificational expressions and the  </li>
    
 </ul>
    
        <h2>McGill University</h2>

     <ul>
     <li><b>Languages of the World</b> (S2021): In this course introduced students to a diverse typology of languages of the world, with a special focus on indigenous languages of the Americas. Students chose a language to work with throughout the semester, culminating in an indepenedent resesarch project. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i67Ahd_gpN4" target="_blank">this video</a> to see the langauges the students chose and their final projects!  </li>
      <li><b>Syntax 1</b> (F2020): This course offered students an introduction to generative grammar, focusing on topics such as X-bar theory, case assignment, DP movement, wh-movement, and Binding Theory.  </li>
      <li><b>Introduction to Linguistics</b> (F2020): I taught the second half of this course which included units on syntax, semantics, pragmatics,  sociolinguistics and historical linguistics.</li>
    
   </ul>
    
    
            <h2>Cornell University</h2>
<ul>
     <li><b>First Year Writing Seminar</b> "Sounds in the World Around Us" (F2015): Students leanred the techniques of academic writing through engagement with literature on linguistics. Topics included the politics of language and language revitalization to the relationship of language and culture, writing systems and neurological correlates of language.</li>
      <li><b>First Year Writing Seminar</b> "The Death of Language" (S2017,F2017): Students learned and practiced techniques of academic writing through engagement with language documentation and preservation literature, with a special focus on languages of the Americas. </li>
     <li><b>Native American Languages</b> (TA): A survey of the diversity of Native American Languages spoken in the US, Canada as well as Latin America. </li>
     
  </ul>

     I am strongly commited to additional teaching opportunities, especially with respect to teaching courses in languages other than English. As such, I was invited to teach a course on semantics for MA students in the Indoamerican linguistics program at CIESAS (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog&iacute;a Social) in San Crist&oacute;bal de las Casas, Chiapas. This course was conducted in Spanish, drawing on the textbook <i>Fundamentos de sem&aacute;ntica composicional</i> by M. Victoria Escandell. In addition to speaking Spanish, all students in this course were speakers of an indigenous language of Latin America. The course culminated in an independent research project detailing how definiteness is marked in their languages.

     Additionally, I have held various workshops and given guest lectures in Spanish and Ch'ol in Chiapas, Mexico for professors and students. Themes included orthography workshops in Ch'ol, the basics of linguistic fieldwork, tutorials on language documentation techniques and a survey of endangered languages
